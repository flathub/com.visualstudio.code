# Visual Studio Code Flatpak

This is an unofficial build of Visual Studio Code, generated from the official Microsoft-built .deb packages.

Most functionality works out of the box, though please note:
* To make the Integrated Terminal automatically use the host system's shell, you can will need to add this command in [Flatpak Warning.txt](https://github.com/flathub/com.visualstudio.code/blob/master/flatpak-warning.txt#L22-L30)
* To gain support for additional langauges, you will need to follow the commands in [Flatpak Warning.txt](https://github.com/flathub/com.visualstudio.code/blob/master/flatpak-warning.txt#L41-L43)
